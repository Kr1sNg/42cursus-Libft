## :sparkles: What is Libft extended ver.?

Libft is an individual project at 42 School that requires students to re-create on their own not only standard C library functions but also some other additionals to build a library of useful functions for themselves.

This is my enhanced library of functions which includes the required Libft of 42 School and my other functions.
